# perfhash

Header-only perfect hash container class for implemented in modern C++

## Getting started

This project does not need to be built. The implementation is header-only,
just include it if you need to.

There's a sample program using the data structure. To try it simply compile
`main.cpp` with your compiler of choice. Just make sure it supports C++14 or
newer.
